# LOOKUP Functions Assignment – Excel

This project contains an Excel assignment focused on practicing LOOKUP and reference
functions using a structured product dataset. The assignment includes real-world
style questions along with formula-based solutions.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- Product ID
- Product Name
- Category
- Price
- Stock
- Supplier

This data is used to perform various lookup, conditional, and reference operations.

## ❓ Questions Covered

- Retrieve stock using Product Name
- Identify the supplier of the product with the highest price
- Find the category of the product with the lowest stock
- Check whether a specific supplier provides products in a given category
- Identify products with stock less than a given threshold using IF and VLOOKUP
- Retrieve values using INDEX
- Fetch product names using VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and INDEX-MATCH

functions to retrieve meaningful insights from data. Specifically, I learned:

- How to use **VLOOKUP** to fetch values based on unique identifiers
- How **HLOOKUP** works for horizontal data retrieval
- How to use **XLOOKUP** as a modern and more flexible alternative
- How to combine **INDEX and MATCH** for dynamic lookups
- How to retrieve values based on **minimum and maximum conditions**
- How to use **IF with lookup functions** for conditional logic
- How to check data existence using **COUNTIFS**
- How to analyze inventory data using price, stock, category, and supplier fields
- How to document questions, formulas, and outputs in a structured manner

## 🧩 Functions Used
